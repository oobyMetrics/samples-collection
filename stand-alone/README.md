- [every-page.js](every-page.js) Add the following code to your site's templates so it appears on every page. We recommend placing it near the top of the `<head>` tag and before any other script or CSS tags. However, it should work almost anywhere on the page.
- [order-tracking.js](order-tracking.js) To record customer orders, this code should be added to your order success page. This code can be placed anywhere on the page after the main code described above.
- [event-tracking.js](event-tracking.js) To record important events, this code should be added to your success page. This code can be placed anywhere on the page after the main code described above.
